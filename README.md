# ImageClassifier-MangoLeafDiseaseDataset

In this code, we have compared the affects of various Activation Funtions on CNN layers and also compared them with a pretrained model (ResNet50).
Furthermore, we have compared the above models with Decision Tree and Random Forest.

To run this:
1> Please install all the necessary libraries
2> Code execution: Simply run it in a Python Environment wih the required libraries installed.

Note:
The code imports image files, applies preprocessing to the data and split it into training, valdation and tests sets. Various kinds of model has been trained on the training set, which is evaluated using the validation set. Finally, the performance of the models is compared and shown in the code.
